## Lua Wireshark Dissectors

Lua wireshark dissector scripts provide an easily customized cross platform dissection solution for viewing common binary exchange protocols. For more information on lua dissectors: [How Lua fits into Wireshark.](https://wiki.wireshark.org/Lua#How_Lua_fits_into_Wireshark "Wireshark's Lua Documentation")

## Usage

To dissect packets, place lua script(s) in the wireshark plugins directory.

The standard path on a windows install:

```
C:\Program Files\Wireshark\plugins\[version]\
```
The standard path on a linux install:

```
//usr/share/wireshark/plugins
```
For all configuration information: [Wireshark Configuration Files.](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChAppFilesConfigurationSection.html "Wireshark Files Configuration Documentation")
## Protocols

|Organization | Protocol | Data | Version | Date | Testing|
|--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|Asx | Itch | Mdp | 2.4.0 | 7/15/2014 | Untested|
|Cme | Sbe | Mdp | 8.1.0 | 7/1/2016 | Verified|
|Cme | Sbe | Mdp | 6.1.0 | 1/9/2016 | Verified|
|Cme | Sbe | Mdp | 5.1.0 | 8/6/2014 | Verified|
|Eurex | T7 | Eobi | 2.5.5 | 11/7/2014 | Known Bug|
|Ice | iMpact | Mdp | 1.24.0 | 3/30/2016 | Verified|
|Miax | Mach | cTom | 1.1.0 | 7/15/2016 | Verified|
|Miax | Mach | Tom | 1.9.0 | 1/15/2016 | Verified|

Note: Some packets contain enough information to programmatically determine the correct protocol specification.  *Some do not.*  If you add multiple dissectors to your plugins folder, wireshark will dissect each "conversation" based on the first matching protocol.

## Development

Updates are greatly appreciated; however, this entire repository is source generated...including the words you are reading right now. Code generation requires a slighty different workflow.  The recommended process is to post a dissector script with suggested edits and explanation.  If the changes are applicable to some or all protocols, we will update the model and regenerate.

Note: Our dissector model is still in beta and subject to rapid development.

Please report any dissection errors as issues.  Include a small note on the protocol and version, what you expect, a zipped minimal capture demonstrating the problem, and a link or pdf specification documenting the correct behavior.
